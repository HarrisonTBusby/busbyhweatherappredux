// Note: Responsiveness was made from 1440p to 390p

Busby's weather app works as intended the site is responsive you are able to favorite cities and delete them. the code is very organized with great use of spacing and comments. The use of Array in the Data Service component was great! The delete button doesn't quite work as intended you need to press delete twice in order to delete it. The favorites button looks like a pipe and can be default to understand what it is used for. I liked the final fantasy theme I would have liked to see him lean into that theme more. overall the web app was well done. (Please no more one winged angel jump scares.
